I'm building a client-side React + Vite web app that parses Texas ISD audit PDFs using pdfjs-dist and displays structured financial data. Everything is already working for:

File upload

PDF parsing (Net Position, Revenues, Expenditures, etc.)

JSON export

GitHub Pages compatibility

Now I want to extend and future-proof the app before deployment. Please do the following:

🧩 1. Add Manual Entry Fallback UI
Below the JSON preview, add a collapsible form for:

Net Position (Assets, Liabilities)

Fund Balances (General, Debt Service)

Revenues (Local, State, Federal)

Expenditures (Instruction, Admin, Debt Service)

Auto-fill these with parsed values

Allow user to correct or enter missing values

Add “Export to JSON” button for edited values

💾 2. Save/Reload Previous Reports
Store parsed JSON in localStorage using the uploaded filename as the key

Add a dropdown or sidebar section to reload any previously parsed report

Display its contents in the same format as a live upload

🧪 3. Add Developer Debug Panel (Hidden Toggle)
Floating “🐞 Debug” button in bottom-right

When clicked, shows:

Raw PDF text output

Section match logs (e.g., “✅ Found 'Statement of Net Position'”)

Regex matches or errors

📤 4. Add CSV Export Button
Next to JSON export, add “Export to CSV”

Flatten the parsed JSON into a single-row CSV with column headers like:

netPosition.totalAssets, revenues.local, etc.

❓ 5. Add Tooltip or Help Icons
Each major field (Net Position, Revenues, etc.) should have a ? icon

When hovered or clicked, show a short description of what that field represents

Example: “Net Position = Total Assets - Total Liabilities”

🗂️ 6. Add Placeholder Pages for Future Expansion
In client/src/pages, create these components with basic placeholders:

Dashboard.tsx – (empty for now, but routed)

ISDExplorer.tsx – for manually entered JSONs

TopTaxpayers.tsx – to be added later

CompareYears.tsx – to eventually show multi-year data

Update routing in App.tsx and Header.tsx to include these links in the nav bar.

⚙️ 7. Add a Basic Settings Modal (Optional)
Include settings like:

Clear all stored reports (localStorage)

Toggle for “Compact JSON” or “Verbose JSON”

Reset to default layout

📁 Final Structure Reminder:
Don’t change what’s already working — just add or scaffold the new features/components so they can be filled in later.
